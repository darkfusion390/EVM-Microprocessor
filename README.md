# Microprocessors
Design a microprocessor Voting Machine which has provision for 4 candidates. It should
keep the count of total votes polled and the count of votes polled for each candidate.
Before being put in use, it should check if all memory location allotted to candidates, and
the total count are empty. If not, it should clear these as well as the display. To put it in
use, it needs to be enabled by 4 polling agents and the Presiding officer. If anyone is
missing it should not be enabled. After 8 hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) it should stop taking
input. There has to be a provision that the Presiding officer by pressing a code [‘CA’] can
lock it in between & then can restart it by pressing [FØ]. For retrieving the count of each
candidate provision should be there. The count of each candidate has to be send to a
remote device using a serial interface. (Do not take into consideration the design of
the remote device and its programming)
